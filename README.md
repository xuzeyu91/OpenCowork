## 🚀 Why OpenCowork?

Traditional LLM interfaces are often "environment-isolated islands." Developers spend 50% of their time copy-pasting code, terminal logs, and file contents between the chat and their IDE.

**OpenCowork solves this by providing:**

- **Local Agency** — Agents can directly read/write files and execute shell commands with your permission.
- **Context Awareness** — No more manual context feeding. Agents explore your codebase and logs autonomously.
- **Task Orchestration** — Complex tasks ("Refactor this module and update tests") are broken down and handled by specialized sub-agents.
- **Human-in-the-loop** — You stay in control with a transparent tool-call approval system.

## 💡 Inspiration

OpenCowork is deeply inspired by **Claude CoWork**. We believe the future of productivity lies in a "Co-Working" relationship where humans provide direction and AI handles the iterative execution, tool manipulation, and cross-platform communication.

## ✨ Key Features

### ⚙️ Core Runtime

- **4-layer Electron architecture** — Main process, Preload bridge, Renderer UI, and Agent runtime running in main process.
- **Provider-agnostic** — Works with any LLM provider; bring your own model.
- **TypeScript throughout** — End-to-end type safety from database to UI.

### 🔄 5 Session Modes

Every conversation chooses the right mode for the task:

- `chat` — Conversational Q&A, no tool access.
- `clarify` — Ask questions to refine vague requirements before execution.
- `cowork` — Full agent mode: code search, file I/O, shell, and sub-agent delegation.
- `code` — Focused code generation and editing with Monaco Editor integration.
- `acp` — Autonomous coding pipeline: plan, implement, review autonomously.

### 🧰 Native Toolbox & Rich Skills

- **Built-in tools** — File I/O, Shell (bash/powershell), Code Search (glob/grep), Web Scraping, OCR, Excel/Word/PDF processing.
- **Extensible Skills** — Load domain-specific capabilities via Markdown-defined skills:
  - **1RPA** — Supplier invoice upload for SRM systems.
  - **CSV Pipeline** — Filter, join, aggregate, and transform tabular data.
  - **Document Suite** — Create & edit DOCX, XLSX, PDF with tracked changes and formatting.
  - **Web Scraper** — Extract structured content from live pages.
  - **Image OCR** — Read text from screenshots and scanned documents.
  - **Email Drafter** — Compose professional correspondence from templates.
  - **WeChat UI Sender** — Send messages via desktop WeChat automation.

### 💬 8 Workplace Messaging Plugins

Bridge your local agents to any messaging platform:

| Platform                  | Support |
| ------------------------- | ------- |
| Feishu / Lark             | ✅      |
| DingTalk                  | ✅      |
| Discord                   | ✅      |
| QQ                        | ✅      |
| Telegram                  | ✅      |
| WeCom (WeChat Work)       | ✅      |
| Weixin (Official Account) | ✅      |
| WhatsApp                  | ✅      |

### ⏰ Persistence & Cron Agent

- **SQLite persistence** — Messages, sessions, projects, tasks, and plans survive restarts.
- **Cron scheduling** — Schedule agents for daily reports, log monitoring, or any recurring task.
- **Multi-channel delivery** — Results can be delivered via desktop notification or any messaging plugin.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 9

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIDotNet/OpenCowork.git
cd OpenCowork
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Key Commands

| Command             | Description                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`       | Start Electron + Vite with hot reload |
| `npm run build`     | Typecheck then build for production   |
| `npm run build:win` | Build Windows installer               |
| `npm run lint`      | ESLint with cache                     |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript check (main + renderer)    |
| `npm run format`    | Prettier auto-format                  |

> **Data directory:** `~/.open-cowork/` — contains SQLite database (`data.db`), config, agents, commands, and prompts.

## 🏗️ Architecture

OpenCowork follows a **4-layer Electron architecture** for security and performance.

```mermaid

  subgraph "Renderer — React 19 UI"

    B --> C[Tool System]
    C --> C1[File I/O]
    C --> C2[Shell]
    C --> C3[Code Search]
    C --> C4[Sub-Agents]
  end

  subgraph "Main Process — System Access"
    E[IPC Handlers]
    F[SQLite / File System]
    G[Shell / SSH]
    H[Messaging Plugins]
    I[Cron Agent]
  end

  subgraph "Agent Runtime — Main Process"
    J[js-agent-runtime.ts]
    K[MCP Client]
    L[LLM Provider Abstraction]
  end

  A -.->|ipcRenderer.invoke| D
  D -.->|ipcMain.handle| E
  E --> F
  E --> G
  E --> H
  E --> I
  A -.->|Direct Call| J
  J --> K
  J --> L
```

- **Renderer** — React 19 UI, agent loop, and tool system.
- **Preload** — Secure `contextBridge` with a narrow API surface.
- **Main Process** — IPC handlers, SQLite, filesystem, shell, SSH, plugins.
- **Agent Runtime** — Provider-agnostic runtime (`js-agent-runtime.ts`) with MCP client support.

## 🌟 Use Cases

- **Autonomous Coding** — Let agents refactor code, fix bugs, and write tests directly in your workspace.
- **Automated Ops** — Schedule agents to monitor logs or system status and report to Feishu/Slack.
- **Data Research** — Agents can scrape web data, process local CSVs, and generate visual reports.

## 🔗 Ecosystem Pairing

### Codex-Manager

- Repository: [qxcnm/Codex-Manager](https://github.com/qxcnm/Codex-Manager)
- Recommended pairing: use Codex-Manager as the management or orchestration entry point for Codex-centric workflows, while OpenCowork handles local file operations, multi-agent execution, workplace messaging, and desktop automation.
- Best for: teams that want to separate task management and workflow organization from local execution and office integration.
- A simple way to think about it: **Codex-Manager organizes the work, OpenCowork executes it in the real workspace.**
