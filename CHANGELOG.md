# Changelog

All notable changes to **OpenCowork** will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Queued message workflow** — per-session FIFO queue with edit/save/delete controls in the composer so you can line up multiple drafts while a run is in progress.
- **Pending message IPC hooks** — renderer now subscribes to queue updates via `subscribePendingSessionMessages`/`getPendingSessionMessages`, keeping UI state and persisted drafts in sync across restarts.

### Changed
- **Composer history navigation** — arrow-key history now integrates with the queued drafts, restoring text, attachments, and metadata exactly as saved.
- **Auto-dispatch after runs** — the next queued draft is automatically sent as soon as the active agent loop finishes, reducing manual resend steps in multi-stage workflows.

### Fixed
- **Draft/attachment desync** — queue + history state now share a single source of truth, preventing stale attachments or mismatched drafts when editing/sending messages rapidly.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Crash logging pipeline** — new `src/main/crash-logger.ts` persists structured JSONL crash events to `~/.open-cowork/logs/crash-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, including process/runtime metadata and normalized payload snapshots.
- **Main-process crash/lifecycle hooks** — `uncaughtException`, `unhandledRejection`, `child-process-gone`, `render-process-gone`, `unresponsive`, and failed main-frame loads are now captured and written to crash logs.
- **Background command sessions** — bash commands can run as managed background processes with session/tool metadata, live output streaming, and stdin write support (`process:write`).
- **Interactive terminal controls in UI** — TopBar badges + DetailPanel terminal view + ToolCallCard actions now support opening, stopping, sending Ctrl+C, and sending stdin to running background commands.
- **Composer input history** — Input area now supports per-session up/down history recall (text + image attachments + draft restoration).

### Changed
- Bash tool now auto-detects long-running commands and runs them in background by default, with `run_in_background` and `force_foreground` controls.
- Provider resolution now supports per-model protocol override (`model.type`), base URL normalization by protocol, and builtin model merging that preserves user-enabled flags while syncing preset metadata.
- Builtin provider lineup expanded with coding-oriented presets (Moonshot/Qwen/Baidu/MiniMax) and refreshed model catalogs in presets (including GPT-5.* / Codex variants and updated thinking configs).
- Agent/tool observability improved with foreground shell exec tracking, richer process state in store, and clearer status surfacing in panel components.

### Fixed
- **OpenAI Responses tools schema** now uses the correct Responses format (`type/name/description/parameters/strict`) instead of Chat-style nested `function`, fixing `Missing required parameter: 'tools[0].name'`.
- OpenAI-compatible chat streaming now exits safely for providers that do not terminate SSE after `tool_calls`/`stop`, preventing hangs in tool argument streaming.
- Agent loop now handles partial/malformed tool argument streams more robustly and finalizes dangling tool calls defensively when providers miss explicit `tool_call_end`.
- `Write` tool now performs explicit input validation and surfaces IPC write failures as tool errors instead of silently returning ambiguous success payloads.
- Session cleanup now tears down session-bound background processes to avoid orphaned runtime state.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Plan Mode pipeline** — new Plan panel, Zustand store, and Enter/ExitPlanMode tools enforce plan-first workflows, write plans to session `.plan/*.md` files, and surface status inside the cowork panel.
- **AskUserQuestion tool & card** — reactive chat card that collects single/multi-select answers (with "Other" free text) and streams results back to the tool call without blocking the UI.
- **Dynamic context injection** — first user turn in Cowork/Code modes automatically includes task/plan/file context, reducing repeated instructions for the agent loop.
- **Persistent plans & tasks tables** — SQLite schema, DAO modules, and IPC handlers store plans/tasks per session for reliable restarts.
- **Shell execution upgrades** — UTF-8 normalization on Windows, binary-output detection, truncation safeguards, and live `shell:output` streaming via exec IDs.
- **Provider preset refresh** — latest OpenRouter/Xiaomi models with thinking configs and pricing metadata plus lazy Monaco-powered fallback viewer for file previews.

### Changed
- Agent loop and chat actions honor plan-mode tool allowlists, auto-register MCP/plugin tools per session, and inject richer debug metadata.
- Right panel layout (Steps, Plan, Artifacts, preview) updated for plan awareness; Command Palette/AppSidebar and localization strings synced with the new workflow.
- Settings pages and provider labels expanded for AskUser/Plan terminology, with improved animated transitions and syntax highlighting lazily loaded as needed.

### Fixed
- Session teardown now clears running-state flags, AskUser pending questions, auto-triggered teammate queues, and plan-mode toggles to avoid leaking into future runs.
- SQLite racing conditions in sessions/tasks/plans DAO layers resolved, ensuring foreign-key safe inserts/updates and consistent IPC responses.
- Shell tool no longer crashes on binary output or garbled encoding; chat tool cards correctly render long tool inputs/outputs with truncation markers.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) full pipeline** — main-process multi-connection manager supporting stdio, SSE, and streamable HTTP transports; IPC endpoints for lifecycle control; renderer-side tool bridge that injects MCP tools into the agent loop.
- **Settings → MCP panel** — create, edit, and manage MCP server configs with transport-aware forms, live capability refresh, and connection status controls.
- **Chat composer MCP awareness** — MCP servers appear in the Skills menu and as inline badges; users can toggle MCP capabilities per session before sending a message.
- **Gitee AI provider preset refresh** — curated DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, Kimi, MiniMax, ERNIE, and Hunyuan models with accurate token limits and thinking support flags.
- **System prompt language injection** — agent system prompt now includes the user's selected language so AI responses match the UI locale.
- **Animated transitions component** (`animate-ui/transitions.tsx`) for smoother UI state changes.
- **Confirm dialog component** (`ui/confirm-dialog.tsx`) for destructive action confirmations.

### Changed
- README repositioned as the open-source Claude Cowork alternative; added provider comparison table, download links, and streamlined quick-start guide.
- Locales (EN + ZH) gained MCP-related strings, ensuring consistent translations across chat and settings screens.
- Settings page restructured with tabbed layout and expanded provider configuration.
- `AssistantMessage`, `ThinkingBlock`, `ToolCallCard`, and `FileChangeCard` components refactored for cleaner rendering and better streaming display.
- Layout simplified — `Layout.tsx` reduced by ~400 lines; panel logic extracted into dedicated components.
- Chat store enhanced with improved session management and message persistence.

### Fixed
- Chat input warnings and badges now reliably reflect active providers, MCP servers, and context window usage before running agent tasks.
